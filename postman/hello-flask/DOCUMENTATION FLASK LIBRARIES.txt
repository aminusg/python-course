DOCUMENTATION

NOTE IN GUIDE:
NOTE: As of November 2022, you will need to use Flask's application context provider 
to instantiate your SQL database as you see toward the end of the lesson 
(either SQLite like in this lesson or other SQL formats when you are building and deploying projects). 
The most direct way to do this is to use the "with" keyword in a Python REPL in conjunction with 
the context provider (be sure to indent last line and press enter more than once if needed to get code to execute):
>>> from app import db
>>> from app import app
>>> with app.app_context():
...    db.create_all()
